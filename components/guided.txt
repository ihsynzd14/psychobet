ScoreSummary
An object that describes a piece of TeamA/TeamB information such as the current score in goals.

{

"IsCollected":true,
"IsReliable":true
}



Score

Score

A Score object

IsCollected

Boolean

True if this data type is being collected for this fixture, False otherwise

IsReliable

Boolean

True if the data values are reliable, False otherwise



Score
An object that holds a head-to-head score for a particular data type.

{
"Home":0,
"Away":2
}



Home

Integer

The Home team's score

Away

Integer

The Away team's score



Clock
An object that provides the current game clock state and time elapsed in the current phase.

{
"IsClockRunning":true,
"TimeElapsedInPhase":PT0S,
"TimestampUtc":2018-02-26T11:35:43.526Z
}



IsClockRunning

boolean

True if the clock is running, false otherwise

TimeElapsedInPhase

TimeSpan



TimestampUtc	Timestamp	
Example
How is the Clock element used for fixture kick-off time corrections under FootballMatchSummary?

The Clock element will be updated in case of a kick-off time change during gameplay. An accurate clock can be maintained by subtracting the TimestampUtc from the current time and adding on the TimeElapsedInPhase. Note that unless there have been any clock adjustments, the TimeElapsedInPhase will be zero throughout the phase, and the TimestampUtc will correspond to when the phase started.

{
"IsClockRunning":true,
 
"TimeElapsedInPhase":PT0S,
 
"TimestampUtc":2018-02-09T11:45:00.000Z
}
To explain the TimeElapsedInPhase even further, lets take an example of a match where the scout updated event start time by 30 seconds when the match has already been ongoing for 5 minutes. Let’s say the event start time is 2018-02-09T11:45:00.000Z as on the example above.

For the kick-off and immediately following before the start time change: TimeElapsedInPhase will be 00:00 and TimestampUtc 2018-02-09T11:45:00.000Z
After the +30 seconds change to the First Half start time: TimeElapsedInPhase will be 5:30 and TimestampUtc will be 2018-02-09T11:50:00.000Z
BetAcceptOk
